# KISS - Keep It Simple Stupid

## KISS Overview
KISS stands for Keep It Simple, Stupid.
This software design principle states that designs, solutions, systems, and products work best if theyâ€™re kept simple.
It means we should favor simplicity over complexity as much as possible.

## Principle
Why should one choose simplicity over complexity is a no brainer
Simpler codes are easy to read, easy to understand and easy to maintain 
However not all the problems that we try to solve are simple and not all solutions can be simple. In such situation one must try to guide the design and code towards simpler alternatives whevever feasible.

Some best practices to help to apply the principle
 - Write smaller code fragments
 - Apply SOLID principle
 - Avoid over engineering. Choose simpler solution over solutions that sound or look cool. 
 - Avoid designing for the future. Keep possibility to extend, but do not overthink the possible future uses, which may never happen

Strive for simplicity without compromising
- functionality: do not reduce the functionality for the sake of simple code
- clarity: do not create ambiguous solution for the sake of simple code
- efficiency: do not create inefficient code for the sake of simple code

Example of how to Implement the principle
